<h2>
  Dorothy Soundsystem will be powering One Foot in the Rave at
  <a href="https://www.burningnest.co.uk" target="_blank">Burning Nest 2018</a>
</h2>

<p>
  OFITR is a brand new soundcamp run by experienced burners who want
  to bring a 'lil slice of rave to the playa. OFITR will offer music,
  a sheltered space to dance, opportunities for burners to DJ and
  perform, as well as providing harm reduction services and
  information.
</p>

<p>
  To make all this happen, our hamsters have been hard at work raising
  funds, but to bring the best camp we can to Nest we're asking
  Nestlings, friends and everyone to donate to our cause! If you'd
  like to help bring the dance to Burning Nest please donate
  <b><a href="https://www.paypal.me/benbrebner" target="_blank">via Paypal</a></b>.
</p>

<p>
  Donated money will be ringfenced from normal camp expenditure and go
  solely towards decor, gifts for the playa, AV and harm reduction
  supplies - we don't want you paying for our lunch!
